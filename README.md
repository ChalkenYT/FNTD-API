# FNTD-API
Values list and DPS chart for FNTD

#Usage

The following is the command to pull a units value on command prompt. You do not need to install anything for this to function.

curl "https://fntd-api.vercel.app/api/values-api?unit_name=Dark%20Frostbear"

Capitalization and spelling matter. Use %20 in between words of a unit. If you are not sure how to spell it, refer to https://sites.google.com/view/fntdvaluecentral/main-page?authuser=0, as our data is based purely on that.
